# Shoplifting-Detection-Using-Transformers
This project aims to automatically detect shoplifting activities from surveillance video footage using deep learning–based video understanding models.
We explore both a baseline 3D CNN (3D ResNet) and an advanced Video Swin Transformer, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling spatiotemporal patterns for human activity recognition.

The Swin Transformer–based model demonstrates high performance in identifying suspicious behaviors, offering a foundation for intelligent retail surveillance systems.

🎯 Objectives

Detect shoplifting behavior in real-world store surveillance videos.

Compare baseline 3D CNN and Video Swin Transformer architectures.

Build a robust preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing video data.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix metrics.
